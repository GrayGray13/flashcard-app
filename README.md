## About
- This app quizzes you on your knowledge of commonly used French words
- Once you start the program, it begins with the first card, and you get 3 seconds to guess the english translation
- You can select the checkmark if you got it right or the x if you got it wrong
  - If you got it right, then it will remove the word from the list, and it will not ask you again
  - You can reopen the app, and it will remember where you left off
